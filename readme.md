# TODO list - jQuery workshop

Description goes here

## Easy install

You dont have any dependencies to develop todo list, but I've prepared small gulp file
which will help you serve and -on-demand-reload any files within this project on any prowser.

If you want to use gulp there are few steps to achieve that:
 * install node.js from https://nodejs.org/
 * add gulp ```npm i -g gulp```
 * make sure youre inside this project and install all dependencies using ```npm i```

To run server type ```gulp develop```
